# LeCorbs DAO — Foundational Declaration

## Preamble

In every society, there are communities left behind — not only economically, but in terms of visibility, recognition, and participation.

**LeCorbs** is a **Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)** designed to offer a new path: one built on **measurable, verifiable, and collectively assumed engagement**.

Inspired by the legacy of *Le Corbusier* and his vision of a Radiant City, LeCorbs reinvents this ideal from the ground up — not imposed from above, but co-constructed by the people who live it.

## Article I — Purpose of LeCorbs DAO

LeCorbs provides a framework for **tokenized social contracts**, enabling communities — especially those from underserved or low-income backgrounds — to:

- formalize their **voluntary contribution** to collective well-being;
- materialize this contribution through a **Local Civic Token (LCB)**;
- link the value of this token to **objective indicators** (education, participation, local entrepreneurship, housing upkeep, etc.);
- generate an **ethical return** based on social conduct and community involvement;
- claim in return a **right to participate** in decisions regarding shared spaces and services.

Each DAO may define how this right is expressed in practice. For example:
- establishing a shared learning and childcare space (inspired by Le Corbusier's rooftop nurseries);
- integrating **AI-supported educational hubs**, supervised by students receiving subsidized housing or active elders contributing time and wisdom.

LeCorbs also promotes **shared responsibility**: in rare and justified cases, the community may vote to exclude individuals who severely compromise harmony, with safeguards ensuring fairness, defense rights, and, ultimately, review by a neutral judicial or administrative authority.

## Article II — HDR, LCB, and the Social Balance

- The **HDR Token** represents the total tokenized value of the **Habitat du Roi® ecosystem**.
- Each local DAO issues a **derived token** (LCB) initially backed by a fractional share of HDR (e.g. 1/250,000).
- The **real value** of an LCB evolves based on a **social performance index** combining:
  - school attendance, graduation rates, academic level, and youth participation in sports or creative programs;
  - a level of delinquency measured relative to national or regional statistical medians;
  - participation in public initiatives;
  - care for shared living spaces;
  - entrepreneurial efforts.

> **T_i(t) = T_i(0) × S_i(t)**  
> Where T is the current value of the token and S is the real-time social index.

This creates a live balance between the macro-value of HDR and the micro-contributions of its local extensions.

## Article III — Ethical Savings

LeCorbs introduces a **new form of community savings**:

- based not on speculation, but on **social proof**;
- generating a return **indexed on virtue and engagement**;
- transferable across generations;
- usable in **local civic economies** or as collateral in broader participatory funding schemes.

The **LCB token** resonates deeply with a motto once imagined for the Euro itself: _**Credimus In Optimum Humanis**_ — *We believe in the best within each human being*.

This token becomes the **support of that belief** — an instrument of trust in human potential, in communities' capacity to rise, contribute, and transform their reality.

This is **programmable dignity** — not just a currency, but a living memory of collective effort.

## Article IV — Vision

> Where others impose, we propose.  
> Where others exclude, we build.

We believe:

- **Virtue can become a store of value**;
- **Engagement can be a stable currency**;
- **Communities can build their own solvency** without waiting for top-down approval;
- The people of today can **rebuild the trust of tomorrow**.

We demand nothing.
We commit — and we provide proof.

## Article V — Scope

LeCorbs is open to **any territory**, **any culture**, and **any group** willing to:

- contract with itself and with its environment;
- demonstrate its value to the commons;
- access a tool for social, civic, and financial empowerment.

It is a **civic lab**, a **distributed architecture of dignity**, and a **framework of collective proof**.

It may even be, in time, a way to renew the promise of social contracts in the 21st century — from the ground up.

> *“A Republic can only stake its future on the active commitment of a sovereign people.”*

LeCorbs gives this promise a body.

🔎 *About the name “LeCorbs”:*  
The name pays tribute to visionary architect **Le Corbusier**, whose dream of a *Radiant City* sought to align design, function, and community.

**LeCorbs** represents a new form of social architecture - decentralized, inclusive, and adaptable - where **civic engagement, not concrete**, becomes the foundation for collective elevation.
