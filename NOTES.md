## üìã Recent Improvements (June 2025)

### üîß Hook Architecture Refactoring - Contract Form Decomposition
**Date**: 2025-06-07

**Major Refactoring Details**:
- **Decomposed `useOfferContractFormEnhanced.ts`** into focused, single-responsibility hooks
- **Created specialized hooks**:
  - `useContractGeneration.ts` - Contract generation and hash management
  - `useFormValidationLogic.ts` - Form validation functions and error handling
  - `useContractStepNavigation.ts` - Step navigation and flow management
- **Maintained functionality** while improving code maintainability and testability
- **Fixed TypeScript errors** related to function signatures and type compatibility

**Technical Benefits**:
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each hook has a clear, focused purpose
- **Better testability**: Smaller hooks are easier to unit test
- **Improved maintainability**: Changes to one aspect don't affect others
- **Cleaner imports**: Components can import only what they need
- **Type safety**: Resolved all TypeScript compilation errors

**Hook Decomposition Structure**:
```
useOfferContractFormEnhanced.ts (orchestrator)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ useContractGeneration.ts (contract & hash generation)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ useFormValidationLogic.ts (validation functions)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ useContractStepNavigation.ts (step management)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ useOfferContractState.ts (state management)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ useOfferContractValidation.ts (validation state)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ useOfferContractActions.ts (contract actions)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ useOfferProjectActions.ts (project operations)
```

**Code Quality Improvements**:
- Eliminated duplicate function definitions
- Fixed missing property errors in state management
- Corrected function signature mismatches
- Added proper null checks and type guards
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing components
