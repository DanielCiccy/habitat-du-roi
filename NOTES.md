## üìã Recent Improvements (June 2025)

### üîê Security Improvements - Route Protection Enhancement
**Date**: 2025-06-11

**Security Enhancement Details**:
- **Protected sensitive routes**: Added authentication requirements to all sensitive pages
- **Fixed security vulnerability**: Prevented unauthenticated access to `/structuration-offre` and other sensitive routes
- **Enhanced route configuration**: Wrapped sensitive routes in `PublicRoute` with `requiresAuth={true}`
- **Consistent authentication enforcement**: Ensured both Demande and Offre flows require authentication

**Routes Protected**:
- `/structuration-offre` - Offer structuring page
- `/confirmation-offre` - Offer confirmation page
- `/contract` - Contract management page
- `/dashboard` - User dashboard
- `/profile` - User profile page
- `/web3-identity` - Web3 identity management
- `/project/:id` - Project details pages

**Technical Implementation**:
- Updated `src/App.tsx` to wrap sensitive routes with authentication protection
- Maintained existing `PublicRoute` component functionality
- Preserved unauthenticated access to public pages (home, auth, qui-nous-sommes, glossary)
- Added proper authentication flow redirection for protected content

**Security Benefits**:
- **Prevented unauthorized access**: Users must authenticate before accessing sensitive functionality
- **Consistent protection**: Both demand and offer flows now require authentication
- **Proper redirection**: Unauthenticated users are redirected to authentication screens
- **Maintained user experience**: Smooth authentication flow without breaking existing functionality

### üé® Navigation Cleanup - Profile Page Enhancement
**Date**: 2025-06-11

**UI Enhancement Details**:
- **Removed redundant navigation**: Cleaned up Profile page by removing duplicate MainNavigation

- **Enhanced focus**: Profile page now focuses on profile content without navigation clutter

**Technical Changes**:
- Updated `src/pages/Profile.tsx` to remove MainNavigation component import and usage
- Maintained Logo component in header for brand consistency
- Preserved all profile functionality while improving visual layout
- Ensured responsive design principles remain intact

**User Experience Benefits**:
- **Cleaner interface**: Reduced visual noise on profile page
- **Better focus**: Users can concentrate on profile management tasks

### üîß Hook Architecture Refactoring - Contract Form Decomposition
**Date**: 2025-06-07

**Major Refactoring Details**:
- **Decomposed `useOfferContractFormEnhanced.ts`** into focused, single-responsibility hooks
- **Created specialized hooks**:
  - `useContractGeneration.ts` - Contract generation and hash management
  - `useFormValidationLogic.ts` - Form validation functions and error handling
  - `useContractStepNavigation.ts` - Step navigation and flow management
- **Maintained functionality** while improving code maintainability and testability
- **Fixed TypeScript errors** related to function signatures and type compatibility

**Technical Benefits**:
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each hook has a clear, focused purpose
- **Better testability**: Smaller hooks are easier to unit test
- **Improved maintainability**: Changes to one aspect don't affect others
- **Cleaner imports**: Components can import only what they need
- **Type safety**: Resolved all TypeScript compilation errors

**Hook Decomposition Structure**:
```
useOfferContractFormEnhanced.ts (orchestrator)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ useContractGeneration.ts (contract & hash generation)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ useFormValidationLogic.ts (validation functions)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ useContractStepNavigation.ts (step management)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ useOfferContractState.ts (state management)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ useOfferContractValidation.ts (validation state)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ useOfferContractActions.ts (contract actions)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ useOfferProjectActions.ts (project operations)
```

**Code Quality Improvements**:
- Eliminated duplicate function definitions
- Fixed missing property errors in state management
- Corrected function signature mismatches
- Added proper null checks and type guards
