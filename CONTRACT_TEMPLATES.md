# 📄 CONTRACT TEMPLATES — Habitat du Roi®

This file introduces a set of **reference contract templates** designed to illustrate the dual-sided structure of the Habitat du Roi® system:

- On the **Supply side**, contracts bind a developer, a landowner, or a public actor to Habitat du Roi® for the purpose of producing or securing a feasibility.
- On the **Demand side**, contracts express the organized commitment of future buyers within a DAO logic (e.g. Le Corbus®), including progressive governance and tokenized engagement.

These templates are **prototypes** and serve as a foundation for discussions, not as final legal instruments.

## Supply-side Agreements

**Purpose**: Provide feasibility for real estate projects that struggle to launch due to financing issues, lack of VEFA guarantees, or an economic equation blocked by excessive margin stacking.

- `developer_feasibility_fr.json` — [French] Contract with a developer for feasibility externalization
- `developer_feasibility_en.json` — [English] Translated version

These contracts aim to **unlock stuck projects** by coordinating structured demand with external feasibility services.

## Demand-side Agreements (DAO Le Corbus®)

**Purpose**: Allow early-stage buyer communities to structure their commitment to a project through:

- symbolic participation (e.g. 1/1000th rule),
- DAO-led decisions on next steps (e.g. land acquisition, architect selection),
- optional expert input (oracles, technical advisors).

Contracts to be added progressively:
- `dao_commitment_fr.json`
- `dao_commitment_en.json`

Each contract can be viewed as a **Smart Agreement Indexed**: enriched off-chain, hashed for traceability, and optionally anchored on-chain when validated.

To illustrate how the Smart Agreement Indexed model applies on the Supply side, we provide a sample contract that links a real estate developer with Habitat du Roi®, specifically for the production and certification of a feasibility study.

Even though this contract is tied to the Supply (as opposed to Demand structuring), it responds to a crucial reality of the market:
many operations fail to materialize due to an inability to secure financing under the current VEFA model, or because the accumulated margin requirements of intermediaries make the equation unworkable.

This agreement allows stalled real estate projects to be reopened under new conditions, by externalizing feasibility through a structured, sovereign DAO logic.
