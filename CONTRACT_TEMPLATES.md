# 📄 CONTRACT TEMPLATES — Habitat du Roi®

At the heart of each contract initiated or co-signed by Habitat du Roi® lies a foundational principle:

> **The Demand comes first.**

Habitat du Roi® may act as co-contractor, facilitator, or service provider, but it always recognizes the **structured Demand** — particularly committed buyers — as the **true beneficiary** of all operations.

To reflect this, all agreements integrated into this repository include the following standard clause:

---

### ⚖️ Clause — Supremacy of the Demand’s Interest and Status of Third-Party Beneficiaries

The Parties acknowledge that although this agreement is concluded between [Name of Provider] and Habitat du Roi®, its primary purpose is to serve a structured need expressed by a collective of prospective buyers (the “Demand”).

Accordingly, individuals or groups who have expressed formal engagement in the project are expressly considered **third-party beneficiaries** within the meaning of applicable civil law, including Article 1205 of the French Civil Code, where relevant.

Habitat du Roi® undertakes to execute this agreement in full compliance with the **superior interest of the Demand**, ensuring that all services or deliverables correspond to the commitments publicly announced to said beneficiaries.

This clause does not release Habitat du Roi® from any of its **own obligations or liabilities toward third parties**, particularly in terms of transparency, due diligence, and contractual responsibility.

In the event of a dispute, the Parties agree that a joint review shall be conducted to determine whether the contractual obligations have been met in light of the legitimate expectations of the Demand. Failing amicable resolution, liability may be engaged based on the consequences for those third-party beneficiaries.

## 📁 Contracts Available


This file introduces a set of **reference contract templates** designed to illustrate the dual-sided structure of the Habitat du Roi® system:

- On the **Supply side**, contracts bind a developer, a landowner, or a public actor to Habitat du Roi® for the purpose of producing or securing a feasibility.
- On the **Demand side**, contracts express the organized commitment of future buyers within a DAO logic (e.g. Le Corbus®), including progressive governance and tokenized engagement.

These templates are **prototypes** and serve as a foundation for discussions, not as final legal instruments.

---

## Supply-side Agreements

**Purpose**: Provide feasibility for real estate projects that struggle to launch due to financing issues, lack of VEFA guarantees, or an economic equation blocked by excessive margin stacking.

- `developer_feasibility_fr.json` — [French] Contract with a developer for feasibility externalization
- `developer_feasibility_en.json` — [English] Translated version

These contracts aim to **unlock stuck projects** by coordinating structured demand with external feasibility services.

---

## Demand-side Agreements (DAO Le Corbus®)

**Purpose**: Allow early-stage buyer communities to structure their commitment to a project through:

- symbolic participation (e.g. 1/1000th rule),
- DAO-led decisions on next steps (e.g. land acquisition, architect selection),
- optional expert input (oracles, technical advisors).

Contracts to be added progressively:
- `dao_commitment_fr.json`
- `dao_commitment_en.json`

Each contract can be viewed as a **Smart Agreement Indexed**: enriched off-chain, hashed for traceability, and optionally anchored on-chain when validated.

To illustrate how the Smart Agreement Indexed model applies on the Supply side, we provide a sample contract that links a real estate developer with Habitat du Roi®, specifically for the production and certification of a feasibility study.

Even though this contract is tied to the Supply (as opposed to Demand structuring), it responds to a crucial reality of the market:
many operations fail to materialize due to an inability to secure financing under the current VEFA model, or because the accumulated margin requirements of intermediaries make the equation unworkable.

This agreement allows stalled real estate projects to be reopened under new conditions, by externalizing feasibility through a structured, sovereign DAO logic.
