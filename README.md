A blockchain-based project for real estate demand tokenization  
[Habitat-du-Roi.com](http://www.habitat-du-roi.com) *->Right-click on the link<-* aims to revolutionize the real estate market by leveraging blockchain technology to structure real estate demand through tokenization.  
This project redefines the connection between property buyers, landowners, and the community by creating a transparent, decentralized platform for more accessible and equitable real estate development.  
For a more detailed description of our model, and how we are reshaping the real estate paradigm, please refer to our [Detailed Model Description](MODELS_DETAILS.md).

## Project Vision

Habitat du Roi seeks to enable a new economic model where real estate demand is given a voice, visibility, and power through tokenization. **By combining traditional tangible assets with the imaginary part of Web3, we aim to achieve a complex economy that benefits all stakeholders.**

## Foundational Principles

As Habitat du RoiÂ® moves toward realizing this vision, the project is guided by key principles:
- **Complex Economy Structure**: Habitat du RoiÂ® operates at the intersection of traditional tangible real estate and the imaginary or intangible part of the Web3 economy. This aligns with our model of a *Complex Economy*, designed to balance both real and tokenized assets.
- **Empowering Demand**: By tokenizing demand, Habitat du RoiÂ® gives a voice to the future buyer, enabling the creation of a collective demand that shapes the real estate market.
- **Community and Ecosystem**: With the aim of decentralizing influence, the project envisions a future ecosystem where individuals and communities directly contribute to project development and value creation through active participation.

## LeCorbs DAO & Local Civic Token (LCB)

As part of this ecosystem, the **LeCorbs DAO** introduces a **Local Civic Token (LCB)** â€” a programmable savings instrument whose value evolves based on the verifiable social performance of its community.

Each LCB is derived from and connected to the HDR token, Habitat du RoiÂ®â€™s generic and global token. It acts as a **DeFi civic extension**, rewarding local virtue and shared responsibility with yield-bearing value. It allows communities to convert trust into tokens and participation into power.

## Smart Agreement Indexed

To support this model of a complex, human-centered real estate economy, Habitat du RoiÂ® introduces a hybrid form of contractualization called the **Smart Agreement Indexed**.

Rather than encoding all logic into on-chain smart contracts, our system allows contracts to be authored and enriched off-chain, then hashed (SHA-256) and recorded as a transaction on the Algorand blockchain. This ensures:

- Full flexibility in how agreements are written and structured,
- Cryptographic proof of integrity and authenticity,
- Minimal costs and fast deployment,
- Future compatibility across multiple blockchain protocols.

This model bridges Web2 and Web3, providing both legal clarity and technical transparency.

## Technical Elements & Technologies Used

Given the complexity of this technical foundation, the founder, an entrepreneur, acknowledges the current limitations in terms of implementing the technology independently. Habitat du RoiÂ® seeks to form a team of skilled developers and blockchain specialists to carry forward this vision. The project's core elements are as follows:

- **Solana Blockchain**: For efficient, secure, and sustainable smart contracts and tokenized assets.
- **Web3 Integration**: Enabling decentralized interaction for users, with transparency and ownership.
- **JavaScript (React, Node.js)**: For front-end and back-end development of the web application interface.
- **Smart Contract Logic**: Designed to manage and tokenize demand, ensuring secure, verifiable transactions.

## Features

- Demand Structuring: Tokenizes real estate demand to create transparent and traceable purchasing power.
- Blockchain-Based Ecosystem: Utilizes blockchain to support decentralized and secure transactions.
- Inclusive Development: Provides an equitable approach for landowners, communities, and small developers.

## Getting Started

This repository contains the foundational elements for Habitat du Roi, including smart contracts, documentation, and application code. Contributions and feedback are welcome to help bring this new vision of real estate to life.

We execute the conversion - making the transition from traditional to tokenized real estate a reality.

**Note:** The founder, though not a technical expert, brings a solid entrepreneurial vision and aims to collaborate with skilled partners to build and expand the technical foundation of Habitat du RoiÂ®. Contributions that align with the hackathon objectives are detailed in each section of the repository. For inquiries regarding technical aspects, please reach out to us.

Habitat du RoiÂ® welcomes contributions from the community to enrich the website and upcoming Web3 applications. Here is how you can get involved and how we manage contributions to ensure quality and alignment with our goals.

### How to Contribute

- Content Enrichment: Community members can suggest new content, features, or improvements to enhance the user experience and expand resources.
- Code Contributions: You can contribute code to our applications and help develop Web3 functionalities. Submit your changes as a pull request (PR) on GitHub, where it will be reviewed by our validation team.

### Validation Process

- Validation Team: An appointed team of administrators, developers, and moderators reviews all contributions. This team ensures that each submission meets our quality standards and aligns with Habitat du RoiÂ®'s objectives.
- Community Governance: We envision a decentralized governance model, where certain changes can be voted on by the community, leveraging Web3 governance mechanisms. These decisions will be based on community participation and investment in the project.

### Quality Assurance

- Security Audits: Regular security audits are performed on Web3 applications to ensure robustness and prevent vulnerabilities.
- Testing Procedures: Contributions undergo testing to verify functionality and avoid introducing errors.

### Stay Updated

To come: All validated updates will be communicated to the community via our blog, social channels, and newsletter. We also encourage contributors to review our [Contribution Guidelines] for more information on submitting high-quality contributions.

Together, we are building a transparent, community-driven platform that redefines real estate through blockchain technology.
