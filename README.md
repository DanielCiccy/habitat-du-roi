A blockchain-based project for real estate demand tokenization
Habitat du Roi aims to revolutionize the real estate market by leveraging blockchain technology to structure real estate demand through tokenization. 
This project redefines the connection between property buyers, landowners, and the community by creating a transparent, decentralized platform for more accessible and equitable real estate development.

## Project Vision
Habitat du Roi seeks to enable a new economic model where real estate demand is given a voice, visibility, and power through tokenization. By combining traditional tangible assets with the imaginary part of Web3, we aim to achieve a complex economy that benefits all stakeholders.

## Features
- Demand Structuring: Tokenizes real estate demand to create transparent and traceable purchasing power.
- Blockchain-Based Ecosystem: Utilizes blockchain to support decentralized and secure transactions.
- Inclusive Development: Provides an equitable approach for landowners, communities, and small developers.
  
## Getting Started
This repository contains the foundational elements for Habitat du Roi, including smart contracts, documentation, and application code. Contributions and feedback are welcome to help bring this new vision of real estate to life.

We execute the conversion - making the transition from traditional to tokenized real estate a reality.
