# Habitat du Roi®: Scenario Descriptions

Below are two detailed scenarios for managing incoming resident flows, access to the real estate market, and revitalizing property assets within a territory for a local community. The first describes the current model, dominated by real estate developers, while the second explores the potential impact of the model proposed by Habitat du Roi®.

### Scenario 1: Current Model (Dominated by Real Estate Developers)

**Context**:  
In the current model, real estate developers play a central role in territorial development. Their decision-making power is often focused on financial profitability, maximizing constructed spaces, and minimal investments in community infrastructure. Local communities have limited influence over project selection and often struggle to meet the specific needs of their population and preferences of new residents.

**Process Steps**:  
1. **Project Selection**: Real estate developers identify potentially lucrative areas for development. Consultation with communities is often superficial, as projects are focused more on financial returns than on the specific needs of the community.
2. **Planning and Permits**: Developers submit projects to communities for approval. Communities often need to negotiate to obtain infrastructure (roads, schools, etc.) necessary for the integration of new residents.
3. **Financing and Construction**: High construction costs and developer margins often result in high prices for future residents, limiting access to affordable housing options.
4. **Resident Reception**: Once the housing is completed, the community must manage the influx of new residents without additional resources to adapt public services and infrastructure. Social costs are high due to the overloading of schools, transportation, and healthcare services.

**Consequences**:  
- **For the Community**: Rapid population growth without adequate adaptation of infrastructure and public services, creating community tensions.
- **For Residents**: Limited access to affordable housing and nearby services. New residents may feel a lack of integration and a decline in quality of life.
- **For the Environment**: This model often leads to soil artificialization, harming biodiversity and increasing the ecological footprint.

### Scenario 2: Model with Habitat du Roi®

**Context**:  
With Habitat du Roi®, the community regains control by structuring incoming flows around the real needs of the population and available resources. Through demand tokenization, Habitat du Roi® can capture future residents' preferences, assess solvent demand, and create a balance between supply and demand. This transforms the real estate market into a more transparent, accessible, and community-centered space.

**Process Steps**:  
1. **Demand Collection and Structuring**: Habitat du Roi® gathers information about future residents, including their housing, infrastructure, and service preferences. Demand is tokenized, allowing priorities to be identified in a precise and transparent way.
2. **Tokenization of Supply**: Communities and landowners collaborate to tokenize available supply, including buildable spaces and development opportunities. Validation by oracles ensures project compliance.
3. **Participatory Planning**: With a clear vision of resident preferences and solvent demand, communities can plan in consultation with potential residents. Decisions are based on structured data, ensuring that infrastructure meets needs.
4. **Funding and Implementation**: Habitat du Roi® promotes infrastructure funding through tokens, reducing the need for bank loans. Developers participate but as facilitators, aligned with community priorities.
5. **Resident Arrival and Integration**: With appropriate planning and sustainable financing, new residents benefit from affordable housing and ready-to-use infrastructure, strengthening social cohesion and quality of life.

**Benefits for the Community**:  
- **For the Community**: Improved anticipation of needs through demand structuring, with infrastructure ready and funded to meet residents' needs.
- **For Residents**: Improved quality of life with affordable housing and adapted community services. The community retains decision-making power, thus preserving territorial harmony.
- **For the Environment**: Rational and measured development, reducing soil artificialization and integrating sustainability principles into planning choices.

**Comparison of the Two Models**:  
In the current model, communities endure developers’ decisions, facing high financial and social costs. With Habitat du Roi®, the territory is proactively managed, integrating the real needs of residents and local capacities for harmonious development. Developers participate, but in a balanced role, serving common interests.

*For the French audience, to reflect the paradigm shift, Habitat du Roi proposes a 'Purchase in Future Completion State.'*
