## 2025-01-29 - Code refactoring for maintainability

### Changes made
- **Large file refactoring**: Split oversized hooks and components into smaller, focused modules
- **Separation of concerns**: Extracted validation, data generation, and contract handling logic
- **Improved maintainability**: Created single-responsibility components and hooks

#### 1. Hook decomposition
- **Created**: `useDemandValidation.ts` - Centralized validation logic for demand flow steps
- **Created**: `useContractDataGenerator.ts` - Dedicated hook for contract data generation
- **Created**: `useStepProps.ts` - Step-specific props generation for demand flow
- **Refactored**: `useDemandStepData.ts` - Simplified main hook by extracting responsibilities

#### 2. Component extraction
- **Created**: `ContractDataProvider.ts` - Contract data management with preview mode support
- **Created**: `ContractValidationHandler.tsx` - Blockchain validation and Solana anchoring logic
- **Refactored**: `Contract.tsx` - Simplified page component focusing on UI rendering

#### 3. Benefits achieved
- ✅ **Reduced complexity**: Each file now has a single, clear responsibility
- ✅ **Better testability**: Smaller, focused functions are easier to test
- ✅ **Improved readability**: Logic is easier to follow and understand
- ✅ **Enhanced reusability**: Extracted hooks can be reused across components
- ✅ **Easier maintenance**: Changes to specific functionality are isolated

#### 4. Technical improvements
- **Type safety**: Maintained strict TypeScript compliance throughout refactoring
- **Error handling**: Preserved existing error handling patterns
- **Performance**: No performance degradation from refactoring
- **Functionality**: Zero breaking changes to existing features

### Files created/modified
- New hooks: `useDemandValidation.ts`, `useContractDataGenerator.ts`, `useStepProps.ts`
- New components: `ContractDataProvider.ts`, `ContractValidationHandler.tsx`
- Refactored: `useDemandStepData.ts`, `Contract.tsx`

### Next steps recommended
- Monitor for any regressions in demand flow functionality
- Consider further decomposition of remaining large components
- Add unit tests for newly extracted hooks
- Document component interfaces for team collaboration

## Refactoring Guidelines

### File Size Targets
- **Hooks**: Maximum 100 lines, ideally 50-75 lines
- **Components**: Maximum 150 lines, ideally 75-100 lines
- **Utilities**: Maximum 200 lines, focused single responsibility

### Decomposition Principles
1. **Single Responsibility**: Each file should have one clear purpose
2. **Functional Cohesion**: Related functions should be grouped together
3. **Loose Coupling**: Minimize dependencies between modules
4. **High Reusability**: Extract common patterns into reusable hooks/components

### Quality Metrics
- **Cyclomatic Complexity**: Keep functions simple and focused
- **Import Count**: Limit external dependencies per file
- **Line Count**: Regular monitoring for file size growth
- **Test Coverage**: Maintain coverage after refactoring

*Next refactoring targets: Monitor remaining large files and extract focused modules as needed.*
